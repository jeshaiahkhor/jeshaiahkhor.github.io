Hello! I am a biomedical/mechatronics engineer passionate about making a positive impact in people's lives through the development of emergent technologies. This looks like many things, ... I hold a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Monash University, during which I developed a prototype wearable vibrating insole device for balance enhancement.

While my PhD is in Biomedical Engineering, I am interested in a wide range of other engineering fields such as ...

I am a recent PhD graduate in Biomedical Engineering from Monash University, currently looking to transition from the tertiary education sector into industry to further develop my technical skills and contribute to meaningful projects that create positive impacts through the private sector.

In my free time, you can catch me tinkering with my [üõ†Ô∏è personal projects](https://jeshaiahkhor.github.io/projects/), on the field chasing plastic discs with [üî• Zealous Ultimate](https://www.instagram.com/zealousultimate/), or travelling to explore more of the vibrant world we live in.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
