Hi, I‚Äôm Jesh, a biomedical and mechatronics engineer with an intense passion for technological innovation and a desire to make a meaningful impact in the world. I specialize in the research and development of cutting-edge technologies and finding practical ways to integrate them into real-world solutions. Whether it's advancing healthcare, enhancing everyday life, or solving complex problems, I am committed to creating positive change in communities.

I hold a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Monash University, graduating as the youngest doctoral graduate of Monash University Malaysia. During my doctoral studies, I designed, constructed, and tested a novel wearable noise-based vibratory insole for balance enhancement. Experimental human trials showed that the insole was able to improve postural control by 4-18%.

In my free time, you can catch me tinkering with my [üõ†Ô∏è personal projects](https://jeshaiahkhor.github.io/projects/), on the field chasing plastic discs with [üî• Zealous Ultimate](https://www.instagram.com/zealousultimate/), or travelling to explore more of the vibrant world we live in.
