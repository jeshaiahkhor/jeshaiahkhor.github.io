Hi, I‚Äôm Jesh, a biomedical and mechatronics engineer with an intense passion for technological innovation and a desire to make a meaningful impact in the world. I specialize in the research and development of cutting-edge technologies and finding practical ways to integrate them into real-world solutions. Whether it's advancing healthcare, enhancing everyday life, or solving complex problems, I am committed to creating positive change in communities large and small.

I hold a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and a Bachelor's in Mechatronics Engineering from Monash University, graduating as the youngest doctoral graduate of Monash University Malaysia. During my doctoral studies, I designed, constructed, and tested a novel wearable noise-based vibratory insole device for balance enhancement. Experimental human trials showed that the insole was able to improve balance by 4-18%. Throughout my research career thus far, I have been part of a wide variety of projects across three main fields: **medical devices**, **robotics systems**, and **automation technologies**. A common thread between the three fields is their interdisciplinary nature - I particularly enjoy working across many different fields to allow for a holistic approach to engineering design.

In my free time, you can catch me tinkering with my [üõ†Ô∏è personal projects](https://jeshaiahkhor.github.io/projects/), on the field chasing plastic discs with [üî• Zealous Ultimate](https://www.instagram.com/zealousultimate/), or travelling to explore more of the vibrant world we live in.

I am currently **open to work** - if you or anyone you know are looking for a passionate, creative, solutions-oriented engineer to solve interesting problems at your , please feel free to contact me via the contact buttons at the bottom of this page.
