### **Charlotte** Lee

Hi! I‚Äôm Charlotte and i‚Äôm craving a ~~drink~~ new opportunitiesüçπ

I‚Äôm a UX researcher on a mission to increase the influence of research on product strategy. To do so, I strive for scientific rigour (as much as practicality allows) in my work, and the triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data to paint a clear reality. Check out my [personal portfolio here](https://uxfol.io/14d5dc49)!

Before I landed in UX research, I majored in psychology in college, and worked as a research assistant at various academic psychology labs. I've always been interested in perception and behaviour, in particular consumer behaviour, human-tech interactions, product marketplaces, gaming psychology, and social psychology, which is how I ended up taking the leap into UX research.
