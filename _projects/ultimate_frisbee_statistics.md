## Background & why data matters to Ultimate
Ultimate Frisbee [^1] is a relatively new sport, but one that is rapidly growing in popularity worldwide. (If you're unfamiliar with the sport, watch a [quick explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnNUEvs2Ev0) or some [exciting highlights of the most recent World Championships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ARMqV2mRI) here!) As a newcomer to the scene, traditional team coaching has been mainly based on the "eye test", requiring highly experienced coaches/players to identify strengths to be honed and weaknesses to be rectified. 

However, this can give rise to a few potential issues. Firstly, as Ultimate is a very dynamic game, it can be difficult for a single coach to identify all the potential moments of interest at once. While this could be remedied by simply having more coaches, due to Ultimate's relative newness, this is not always possible for many non- or semi-pro teams. Secondly, even experienced coaches are only human - as much as we try to avoid it, unconscious bias can creep into the system. As such, having a data-driven, objective reference point can serve as a grounding point for coaches, assisting them and allowing them to do more with less.

Some great attempts have been made on performing various forms of data analytics in the AUDL, including pass maps in [Inverted Pivot](https://invertedpivot.com/audl) and pass values (akin to those found in soccer) [UltiMaps](https://hirosme.shinyapps.io/UltiMaps/). However, 

- Data is limited (AUDL only, even then limited seasons); not generalizable to existing teams
- Difficult for any teams outside the AUDL to collect
- Real-time collection not currently possible/feasible
